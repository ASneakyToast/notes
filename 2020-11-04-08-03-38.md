# Markdown

This is a markdown note. Just for testing. 

# markdown
Super cool, this could be excatly what I'm looking for to use with our jekyll github pages site. 

## Integrating with our repo?
It'd have to go straight to our repo and to the posts folder. Although I'm sure this will work if it lets me pick a repo. 

## What happens if I insert my own front matter?
The app said certain things are already in the front matter. If I change this to raw mode I can see the front matter. Should make this clear to Marisa.

## Pushing to github.
I wonder how it does this, maybe using a token or logging in every time. How often does it push?
