# Markdown

This is a markdown note. Just for testing. 

# markdown
Super cool, this could be excatly what I'm looking for to use with our jekyll github pages site. 

## Integrating with our repo?
It'd have to go straight to our repo and to the posts folder. Although I'm sure this will work if it lets me pick a repo. 

## What happens if I insert my own front matter? The app said certain things are already in the front matter.
