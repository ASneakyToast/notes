title: Text based video games = better web surfer?
---

I've always been easily frustrated at bad user experiences (ux design) that are created because the user neglects to read the text on the screen. 

While I've also been thinking about how videos games affect little kids brains and came up with this theory that people who played "conversation locked" video games. These types of games prevent the player, or make it way harder, to progress in the game without reading the text that displays when interacting with certain nouns.
